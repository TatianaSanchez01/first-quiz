#System Security

To ensure the security of the solar panel installation app infrastructure, we could consider the following aspects in relation to the OWASP Top 10 for 2021:

1. **Injection**: Looking for vulnerabilities that could allow SQL injection in the Python backend. Ensure that input data is properly validated, sanitized, and parameterized to prevent malicious input from compromising your MySQL database.

2. **Broken Authentication**: Ensure that user authentication and session management are robust and that there are no weak authentication mechanisms. Utilize secure authentication protocols like OAuth2 or JWT for mobile and web applications.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Verify that customer information, including passwords, is securely stored and transmitted. Implement encryption and secure key management practices for sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.

4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Checking for XML-based vulnerabilities in the application, particularly if XML is used in any way. Disable XML external entity processing to prevent XXE attacks.

5. **Broken Access Control**: Review the access control mechanisms in the system. Ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform actions. Using proper authentication, authorization, and session management to prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Security Misconfigurations**: Perform a thorough review of the Kubernetes deployment on AWS. Ensure that security groups, access controls, and configurations are correctly set. Avoid exposing unnecessary services and limit privileges for employees based on their roles.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Scan the web frontend for potential XSS vulnerabilities. Implementing input validation and output encoding to prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by customers.

8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Review the deserialization mechanisms in the application, particularly in the backend. Ensure that data passed between components is securely serialized and deserialized to prevent deserialization attacks.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Regularly update and patch all software components, libraries, and dependencies used in your system, including Kubernetes, Python, and JavaScript frameworks, to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with outdated components.

10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**: Implementing robust logging and monitoring solutions to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Ensure that you have visibility into system activities and that you can monitor for unusual or suspicious behavior.

Additionally, I would consider the following security measures adjust to this structure:

Limit the access of the software engineers to only the resources and systems necessary for their work. Employ the principle of least privilege to minimize potential insider threats.

Implement strict access controls for the customer support employees, allowing them to view and modify customer information and orders only based on their job requirements.

Train and educate all employees, including the sales employee, on security best practices and awareness of potential security risks.

Conduct regular security assessments, such as penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and address vulnerabilities in the infrastructure.

By addressing these security concerns and following best practices, we significantly enhance the security of the solar panel installation app and protect customer data and system integrity.
